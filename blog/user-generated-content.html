If you are an ‘extreme sports’ lover, you might often watch thrilling adventure  videos in YouTube, people cycling in jolty narrow mountain top, surfing in the  turbulent ocean, skating on high buildings, rock climbing, skyboarding and many  more. These people who share videos of their stimulating experience need top  functioning video cameras. GoPro, a manufacturer company and marketer of small,  portable, high definition video cameras, serves a great deal of opportunity to its  users to record their exciting adventures. These cameras are attached to the user's  head or bike and help the viewers to have a first-person perspective of what the  athletes are seeing.  
                </p>


                <p align=justify>
   GoPro saw that many of their customers are happy to share these type of videos in  social media like Facebook, Instagram and youtube. These posts massively helped  the company get popularity without putting much effort. In 2010, the company  decided to collaborate with customers and made users’ videos key to their  promotion strategy. Now, if you visit GoPro’s Instagram or youtube page, you will  see their timeline flooded with consumers' videos. Some of them are sent by  traditional users, while professional athletes make others. That's how this company  engaged its customers and shared their contents to attract other customers. Here the  marketing strategy GoPro is using is called <b>User Generated Content</b>. 
               
  </p>



                <p align=justify>
 In this century of undeniable dominance of social media, Today’s businesses have  to put so much effort to promote their brand in online platforms where most of  their potential customers spend a massive portion of their time. In fact, many  businesses have to go through so many trial and error session to find the right  method to attract their consumers online. In this tenacious era of digital marketing, 
imagine having your own consumers promote your brand and products. This type  of marketing strategy is widely known as <b>User Generated Content</b>.    
                </p>



                <p align=justify>
<b>User-Generated Content (UGC)</b>, also called <b>User-Created Content (UCC)</b>, is  the contents such as text, image, audio or video created by consumers. The  substances of these contents directly relate to the product or service of the firm and  are usually posted by the customers in social media platforms. <b>UGC</b> can also come  from customers’ rating on the business web page. Businesses can use user generated content to showcase the aspects of their product or service through the  eyes of their customers. 

                </p>



                <p align=justify>
  To get more clear ideas of <b>UGC</b>, let’s picture a scenario here. Suppose you bought a  cool t-shirt from a store. Being satisfied with the product, you posted a photo of  yourself in your Facebook wall wearing the t-shirt and mentioned the brand name  of the t-shirt. Your Facebook friends will observe your satisfaction with the  product. Now, if they are also a great fan of t-shirts, they most probably will attempt to buy a t-shirt from the same store you bought your t-shirt from. In this  example, the very photo you posted on Facebook is the <b>User-Generated Content</b>. Through this content, you have promoted the brand being entirely unpaid for it.  

                </p>


                <p align=justify>
   Traditional ways of brand promotion are losing their beauty. Also, traditional  advertising can be costly. Again social media marketing, search engine marketing,  influencer marketing and other digital marketing tools can be expensive too. The  unfortunate part is that many customers do not find the promotional contents created by brands reliable. Today’s customers want to hear actual reviews of products from other customers before buying them. In fact, 70% of consumers will consider UGC reviews before making a purchase. That’s how <b>UGC</b> can significantly drive customers' purchasing decision despite the firm spending almost  no money behind it.  

                </p>



              <p align=justify>
 Therefore, undoubtedly positive customer input is very crucial for businesses  nowadays. All kind of businesses starting from startups to big companies like  Netflix and BMW are being greatly benefited from customer reviews through  different contents. <b>UGC</b> can come totally deliberately from consumers in a desire  to demonstrate a high-class lifestyle. Sometimes firms particularly ask their  consumers to share their experience with the product. Firms also can create their  own hashtag and encourage customers to post their content using the hashtag. Sometimes firms offer gifts to customers who share their contents; this also  impulses customers to share their contents in social media. Firms always have the  option to share those contents on their pages with the permission of their  audiences.  
               </p>



             <p align=justify>
  Here are some reasons why <b>User-Generated Content</b> is an effective method of  digital marketing: <br>
  
  <ul>

    <li>Authentic <b>User-Generated Content</b> provides proof of the quality of the  products or services. About 92% of customers trust <b>UGC</b> more than  advertising.</li>
    <li>It is a great way to attract new customers. 48% of customers say they  discover new brands through peer review. </li>
    <li>It creates an opportunity for customers to discuss and share information about  the brand.</li>
    <li>It can go a long way to make the consumers feel like their opinion is being  valued.</li>
    <li>It builds long term customer relationship based on trust.</li>

  </ul>

                </p>


                           <p align=justify>
  To sum it up, we can say that <b>User-Generated Content</b> has become a trustworthy  medium for customers to assess the quality of the products. The power of this  promotion strategy is silent yet so strong. Like a campus needle points north, the  customers will always find ways to know more about products they care about  before buying them. Therefore, a business needs to engage its users in a more  organized way to provide positive and useful information to potential customers.  Firms need to embrace this strategy, along with other traditional promotional  methods, to get the best outcome.
